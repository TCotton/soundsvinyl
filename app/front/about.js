					`About SoundsVinyl`
				</h2>

				<section>
					<p>
						`SoundsVinyl started as a music recommendation site that
						concentrated on 7 inch and 12 inch vinyl single releases; but this
						site isn’t about vinyl, that’s the hook on which to hang it.`
					</p>

					<p>
						`This site could be interpreted as an exercise in nostalgia. It was
						never intended to be that. If music doesn’t come up from the
						streets, it loses its vitality. In fact, a vinyl collectors club has
						all the cultural buzz only of a stamp collectors club.`
					</p>

					<p>
						`SoundsVinyl is a site about music. What underpins our attraction to
						music – perhaps all art – is the emotion and the memories that we
						attach to it. Music is both a communal and a solitary experience. We
						can share it together with thousands of others or experience it on
						our own on repeat until we drain all feeling from what we are
						playing.`
					</p>

					<p>
						`The sounds highlighted on this site may offer you a different,
						brief glimpse of sublimity; an emotional epiphany which popular
						culture is capable of providing just as much as high art can.`
					</p>

					<p>
						`SoundsVinyl may offer you a snippet of a rhythm or a songwriter’s
						verse, which may, in turn, inspire you to seek out more from the
						same artist. But never aim to emulate. What originated from a
						particular historical era can’t be copied. What has been, has now
						died and can’t be revived. Sentimental nostalgia is inherently
						conservative and counter-revolutionary, while hauntology at the end
						of the second decade of the 21st century is listless to the point of
						death. Create something new.`
					</p>

					<p>
						`I hope that there may be something on here that inspires you in
						your endeavours; whether you are a game creator, a writer, or a
						designer. But if there isn’t, come back and visit again next week or
						next month, as I regularly update the site with all styles of
						music.`
