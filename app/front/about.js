				<h2>About SoundsVinyl</h2>

				<section>

					<p>This site isn’t about vinyl, that’s the hook on which to hang it. This site isn’t necessarily about music, and it certainly isn’t intended as a focus for musicology. What underpins our attraction to music – perhaps all art – is the emotion and the memories that we attach to it. Music is both a communal and a solitary experience. We can share it together with thousands of others or experience it on our own on repeat until we drain all feeling from what we are playing.</p>

					<p>This site could be interpreted as an exercise in nostalgia. It was never intended to be that. If music doesn’t come up from the streets, it loses its vitality. In fact, a vinyl collectors club has all the cultural buzz only of a stamp collectors club.</p>

					<p>The sounds highlighted on this site may offer you a different, brief glimpse of sublimity; an emotional epiphany which popular culture is capable of providing just as much as high art can.</p>

					<p>SoundsVinyl may offer you a snippet of a rhythm or a songwriter’s verse, which may, in turn, inspire you to seek out more from the same artist. But never aim to emulate. What originated from a particular historical era can’t be copied. What has been, has now died and can’t be revived. Sentimental nostalgia is inherently conservative and counter-revolutionary, while hauntology at the end of the second decade of the 21st century is listless to the point of death. Create something new. </p>

					<p>I hope that there may be something on here that inspires you in your endeavours; whether you are a game creator, a writer, or a designer. But if there isn’t, come back and visit again next week or next month, as I regularly update the site with all styles of music.</p>
