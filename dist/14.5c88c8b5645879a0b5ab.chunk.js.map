It was\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnever intended to be that. If music doesn’t come up from the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstreets, it loses its vitality. In fact, a vinyl collectors club has\n\t\t\t\t\t\tall the cultural buzz only of a stamp collectors club.`\n\t\tconst $thirdPara = `SoundsVinyl is a site about music. What underpins our attraction to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmusic – perhaps all art – is the emotion and the memories that we\n\t\t\t\t\t\tattach to it. Music is both a communal and a solitary experience. We\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcan share it together with thousands of others or experience it on\n\t\t\t\t\t\tour own on repeat until we drain all feeling from what we are\n\t\t\t\t\t\tplaying.`;\n\t\tconst $fourthPara = `The sounds highlighted on this site may offer you a different,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbrief glimpse of sublimity; an emotional epiphany which popular\n\t\t\t\t\t\tculture is capable of providing just as much as high art can.`;\n\t\tconst $paraFive = `SoundsVinyl may offer you a snippet of a rhythm or a songwriter’s\n\t\t\t\t\t\tverse, which may, in turn, inspire you to seek out more from the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsame artist. But never aim to emulate. What originated from a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tparticular historical era can’t be copied. What has been, has now\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdied and can’t be revived. Sentimental nostalgia is inherently\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconservative and counter-revolutionary, while hauntology at the end\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof the second decade of the 21st century is listless to the point of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeath.
