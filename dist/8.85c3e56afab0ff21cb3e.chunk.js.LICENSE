// For IE 6â€“8

// Create a <script> element; its readystatechange event will be fired asynchronously once it is inserted

// into the document. Do so, thus queuing up the task. Remember to clean up once it's been called.

// For non-IE10 modern browsers

// Callback can either be a function or a string

// Copy function arguments

// Store and register the task

// From the spec: "Wait until any invocations of this algorithm started before this one have completed."

// So if we're currently running a task, we'll need to delay this invocation.

// Delay by doing a setTimeout. setImmediate was tried instead, but in Firefox 7 it generated a

// Here we have async deferring wrappers using microtasks.

// In 2.5 we used (macro) tasks (in combination with microtasks).

// However, it has subtle problems when state is changed right before repaint

// (e.g. #6813, out-in transitions).

// Also, using (macro) tasks in event handler would cause some weird behaviors

// that cannot be circumvented (e.g. #7109, #7153, #7546, #7834, #8109).

// So we now use microtasks everywhere, again.

// A major drawback of this tradeoff is that there are some scenarios

// where microtasks have too high a priority and fire in between supposedly

// sequential events (e.g. #4521, #6690, which have workarounds)

// or even between bubbling of the same event (#6566).

// The nextTick behavior leverages the microtask queue, which can be accessed

// via either native Promise.then or MutationObserver.

// MutationObserver has wider support, however it is seriously bugged in

// UIWebView in iOS >= 9.3.3 when triggered in touch event handlers. It

// completely stops working after triggering a few times... so, if native

// Promise is available, we will use it:

/* istanbul ignore next, $flow-disable-line */

// In problematic UIWebViews, Promise.then doesn't completely break, but

// it can get stuck in a weird state where callbacks are pushed into the

// microtask queue but the queue isn't being flushed, until the browser

// needs to do some other work, e.g. handle a timer. Therefore we can

// "force" the microtask queue to be flushed by adding an empty timer.

// PhantomJS and iOS 7.x

// Fallback to setImmediate.

// Techinically it leverages the (macro) task queue,

// but it is still a better choice than setTimeout.

// Use MutationObserver where native Promise is not available,

// e.g. PhantomJS, iOS7, Android 4.4

// (#6466 MutationObserver is unreliable in IE11)

// The template compiler attempts to minimize the need for normalization by

// For plain HTML markup, normalization can be completely skipped because the

// generated render function is guaranteed to return Array<VNode>. There are

// two cases where extra normalization is needed:

// 1. When the children contains components - because a functional component

// may return an Array instead of a single root. In this case, just a simple

// normalization is needed - if any child is an Array, we flatten the whole

// thing with Array.prototype.concat. It is guaranteed to be only 1-level deep

// because functional components already normalize their own children.

// 2. When the children contains constructs that always generated nested Arrays,

// e.g. <template>, <slot>, v-for, or when the children is provided by user

// with hand-written render functions / JSX. In such cases a full normalization

// is needed to cater to all possible types of children values.
