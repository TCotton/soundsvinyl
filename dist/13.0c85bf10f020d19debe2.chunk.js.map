What underpins our attraction to music – perhaps all art – is the emotion and the memories that we attach to it. Music is both a communal and a solitary experience.

But never aim to emulate. What originated from a particular historical era can’t be copied. What has been, has now died and can’t be revived. Sentimental nostalgia is inherently conservative and counter-revolutionary, while hauntology at the end of the second decade of the 21st century is listless to the point of death.
